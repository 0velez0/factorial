# Factorial
Compute the factorial of a given input non-negative integer.

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method that computes factorial of the input non-negative integer and returns it.
* Factorial of a number, 'n' is represented as *n!* and is defined as follows:
   - *0!* = *1*
   - *n!* = *n * (n-1)!* if *n* > 0
   -      = *n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1*
* For example, 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6. 6! = 720.
* Share and explain the time and space complexities for your solution.
* If you think of multiple approaches to solve the problem, implement the solution which minimizes space complexity. Explain the other approaches, and your decision in comments above the code.
